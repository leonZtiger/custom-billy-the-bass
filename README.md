Code for controlling billy the bass using a esp32

# Setup

## code
If using a esp32-wroomer no changes needed.
If not check how to wire the sd card correctly and change the outputs pins in the code.
Also remeber that the audio out must be connected to a DAC output.
See your board specs to know what type of pins are located where.

Note that the amplifier circuit is not included, buy a reasonable good one instead in the 1-2 watt range.

## Placement
Wire each component correctly and upload the code to the esp32.
If needed saw of some parts on the backboard to make the speaker fit.
Lastly after cheking that everything fits glue all the part inside the board and screw it together.
